#	Welcome to Scrap Paper.

Scrap Paper is a simple, open-source notes app written entirely in Swift. It highlights a subset of Markdown as you type — common syntax like *italic* and **bold**, as well as

* Unordered lists
* You can even have more than one bullet!

##	Does the world need another notes app?

**No!** The App Store is full of excellent writing and notes apps! However, I’ve been working on variations of notes apps for a while as a way to learn new things and have fun programming. Then I saw Nick Lockwood’s cool [retro rampage](https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage) tutorial series, and it inspired me to turn what I’ve learned in my little Notes apps into a tutorial series of my own.

Things we will cover:

* The basics of working with Core Text
* Editing text efficiently in a Piece Table
* Parsing Expression Grammars
* Incremental Packrat Parsing
* Moving beyond plain text: Databases, SQLite, and iCloud synchronization
